# Rainfall-Analysis

# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing rainfall data across various Indian subdivisions from 1901 to 2015. Using SQL, we explore patterns in monthly and seasonal rainfall to identify trends, extremes, and variations in rainfall for different regions. This analysis is crucial for understanding long-term climate behavior and supporting water resource management across India.

# Objective
The main objectives of the analysis include:

Identifying trends and anomalies in rainfall patterns across India.
Extracting insights on regional rainfall to guide climate and environmental studies.
Supporting water resource planning and policy formulation by analyzing regions with high or low rainfall extremes.

# Data Structure
The dataset includes columns for each month and season, as well as annual totals for rainfall. The fields are as follows:

Subdivision - Geographical subdivision of India
Year - Year of the rainfall record
Monthly Rainfall (Jan - Dec) - Rainfall data for each month
Seasonal Rainfall:
Jan-Feb - Winter season
Mar-May - Pre-monsoon season
Jun-Sep - Monsoon season
Oct-Dec - Dry season
Annual - Total annual rainfall

# Analysis Tasks
The project includes SQL queries to perform various analyses, such as:

# Subdivision with Highest Rainfall in June: 
Find the subdivision with the highest average rainfall in June across all years.

# Total Annual Rainfall: 
Calculate the total annual rainfall for each state.

# Monsoon Rainfall (Year 2000):
Identify the subdivision with the highest rainfall during the monsoon season (June to September) for the year 2000.

# Top 5 Rainiest States in Winter: 
Determine the top 5 states with the highest rainfall in January and February.

# Average Monthly Rainfall:
Calculate average monthly rainfall for each subdivision from 1901 to 2015.

# Rainfall Trends (1901-2015): 
Assess the trend in rainfall for each subdivision over time.

# Wettest Year: 
Find the year with the highest total rainfall across all subdivisions.

# Dry Season Analysis:
Identify the subdivision with the lowest average rainfall during the dry season (October to December).

# High Rainfall in July: 
Locate subdivisions where average rainfall in July exceeds 500 mm.

# Comparative Rainfall Analysis:
Compare total rainfall between two specific states (e.g., Kerala and Tamil Nadu).

# Top 10 Wettest Years:
Identify the 10 years with the highest rainfall for a specific subdivision.

# Decadal Rainfall Analysis:
Calculate average annual rainfall for each decade across all subdivisions.

# Rainfall Difference Between Months:
Find subdivisions with the highest rainfall difference between June and October.

# Pre-Monsoon Rainfall Ranking:
Rank subdivisions by average rainfall during the pre-monsoon season.

# Lowest Monsoon Rainfall: 
Identify the top 5 years with the lowest monsoon season rainfall across India.

# Yearly Trends for Specific Subdivision: 
Display yearly rainfall trends for a subdivision with its highest rainfall year.

# Subdivision Rainfall Ranking: 
Show the rank of a subdivision by annual rainfall, focusing on those with high rainfall in July.

# Rainfall Comparison for October and August: 
Compare the lowest rainfall in October with the highest in August.

# Stored Procedure
A stored procedure is included to extract records of annual rainfall, making it easier to retrieve and analyze data across years and subdivisions.

# Conclusion
This rainfall analysis provides valuable insights into regional rainfall patterns across India, highlighting areas with extreme weather patterns. Such data can aid climate research, enhance understanding of monsoon impacts, and inform regional water resource strategies.
